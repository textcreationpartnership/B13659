            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Omomathes,</hi> when the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the three Lawes was finiſhed, gaue himſelfe to his recreation, which was the hunting of the Bucke, an exerciſe commendable for Gentlemen, and vſed in auncient time of them, whoſe high eſtates had entitled them with the names of <hi>Heroes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Semidei.</hi> But when winter began to ſhed his cold influence, and to repleniſh the aire with congealing vapours, to make the earth as it were a naked beldam, and to cauſe the dugges of the ſea to ſwell with ſurg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing billowes, <hi>Nomomathes</hi> retired to his bookes, and gaue a farewel to the fields, betrothing himſelfe that winter to his ſtudie. And becauſe the iuice of the late conference of the Lawes had turned to good bloud in his mind, he meant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue the conference, of which he had a more ſtrict regard then of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
<pb facs="tcp:177736:4"/> For when it was rumord in the countrie where <hi>Nomomathes</hi> dwelt, that ſuch a conference was had: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward certain copies were diſperſed, and diuulgated, ſome were wel pleaſed, ſome were diſcontented with the Dialogues: <hi>Pro captu lectoris habent ſua fata libelli.</hi> Amongſt the reſt that were diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted was a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a plaine countrie man, and a gentle man not vnlearned, who when they had heard, that <hi>Nomomathes</hi> meant to reuiue and recontinue the conference, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go to his houſe, and to open their mindes as they conceiued of the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Their purpoſe they followed, and to the houſe they came, where beeing kindly and curteouſlie entertained of <hi>Nomomathes,</hi> and in their by-talke glaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at the Dialogues: <hi>Nomomathes</hi> willed them to ſpare no ſpeech, and profeſſed that hee would willinglie admit their cenſures, and that he would heare them in order: They ſeeing his patience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, deliuered in few words their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conceits. And firſt the gentleman
<pb facs="tcp:177736:5"/> tooke exception to the diſcourſes of <hi>Codicgnostes:</hi> for that he in the firſt Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, diſcuſsing matters of common weale, and of the Ciuill Law, did forget to handle verie important matters, and to his profeſsion not impertinent. The firſt was becauſe hee did not treat of Dettes, a thing in the Ciuill Law not omitted: and yet in no Law ſufficiently debated. Secondly, he ſpeaketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Accompts or reckonings, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that is a large and frequent title in the Ciuill Law. Laſtly ſpeaking <hi>ex profeſso</hi> of the originall of Tenures and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices in the fourth Dialogue, he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth verie little of Conditions, which verie often are the conſtituent cauſes of theſe Seruices: With this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and then ſpake the Parſon, who did expoſtulate with the <hi>Canonist</hi> ſome iniuries, becauſe the Canon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo full and pregnant in matter of Tythe, hee did not vouchſafe to ſpeake anie one woord of Tythes: And whereas we haue Parſons ſaid he,
<pb facs="tcp:177736:5"/> haue much impediment by <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> and many times wrong, when they come to triall: for the countrie people which are the Iurors, who haue no more deſire to paie their Tythes, then the Diuel hath to loſe his entercourſe with the ſeauen deadly ſinnes; the Pope to be a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and a Beare to go to the ſtake. If any Prohibition concerning Tythes come to be tried by them, ar as ſure to paſſe againſt the Parſon, as an old chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is ſure of blacknes. But let any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come to be tried touching common, which concerneth themſelues, and their owne profit, they will as ſurelie go with the commoner, as the cloudes goe with the Northeaſt wind: Therefore it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him to be verie conuenient, that becauſe the Canon doth ſo much fauour Parſons, that therefore the Canoniſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſhould haue debated at large of theſe matters: And he thought the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſt ſpeaking ſo little of them in the whole diſcourſe, was much troubled with the tooth-ache, (the Canoniſt here
<pb facs="tcp:177736:6"/> being ſomewhat cholericke interrupted him, and ſaid he iangled: for he ſaid there were manie thinges propoſed in the Dialogues, which the Canon Law neuer medleth with all, neither hath it ſo much taſted of them, as the dogge licking of <hi>Nilus:</hi> And in ſome thinges which were in the Dialogues, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law hath nothing els, but which the Ciuill Law hath: ſo that he ſhould not haue kept <hi>decorum,</hi> but ſhould haue thruſt his ſicle into the harueſt of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicgnostes,</hi> if he ſhould haue encroched vpon ſuch thinges, as the Canon Law hath as it were at the ſecond hand ſtrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the Ciuill. But, ſaid he, as touching Tythes, if any queſtion had been propoſed, I would not haue been defectiue in the handling them at large. Then the poore Countrie man made a lowe conge, and <hi>Nomomathes</hi> bowed vnto him, as being willing to heare him. Sir (quoth he) I am by your worſhips fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour a poore countrie yeoman, dwelling neare a place called <hi>Aitipolis:</hi> and my
<pb facs="tcp:177736:6"/> yeares are more then my knowledge, my patrimonie better then my education, and my hand more nimble then my toong: And I haue had a verie great deſire to haue ſome vnderſtanding of Lawe, becauſe I would not ſwim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtreame, nor be vnlike vnto my neighbours, who are ſo full of Law-points, that when they ſweat, it is nothing but Law; when they breath, it is nothing but law; when they neeſe it is perfite law; when they dreame it is profound law. The booke of <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons tenures</hi> is there breakfaſt, their din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, their boier, their ſupper, and their rere-banquet: Euerie plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwayne with vs may bee a Seneſchall in a Court Baron: Hee can talke of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoines, Vouchers, Withernams, and Recaptions: And if you controll him, the booke of the Groundes of the Law is his porteſſe, and readie at his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to confute you.

<pb facs="tcp:177736:7"/> will make you beleeue, that all is gold, which gliſtereth: So that for a man to be amongeſt them, and to haue lyuing and want Law: is as if a man ſhould haue bread to eate, and want teeth to chew it: Which occaſions mooued me at the firſt to ſeek for ſome skill in Law, and amongeſt other bookes, I bought <hi>The Conference of Law,</hi> whereof hath been ſpoken, and caſting mine eie vpon the diall of common wronges, and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes: I wondered that he which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the Common Law, amongeſt his common wronges and treſpaſſes, he ſpoke nothing of Waſt done in a mans ground: and verie little of an Action vpon the caſe, which is a wheele much turned about in the place where I dwel. And though hee hath deliuered much of Iointenants, and Tenants in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he ſpeaketh either little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of Parceners. Now manie of vs countrie people marrie verie often with landed women, and therefore would gladly be ſeene in that learning.
<pb facs="tcp:177736:7"/> Truely Sir I bought the booke for my more vnderſtanding of the law, and for the noueltie, and becauſe it was in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh: yet there is a vengeance deale of Latin in it, which put mee to the coſt to buy a <hi>Thomaſes</hi> Dictionarie, but it is no great matter for that, for it wil ſerue my ſonne <hi>Reginold,</hi> when he ſhall bee tenne yeares olde, or thereabout: But I pray you ſir at the next conference let vs haue ſomewhat of theſe matters, which I haue mentioned vnto you: When hee had ceaſed to ſpeak, <hi>Nomomathes</hi> grauely and with aduiſe cenſured their cenſures, and ſpoke in this manner. I ſee now (ſaide he) the prouerbe to be verified <hi>Quot ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines tot ſententiae.</hi> there be as many minds as there bee men; And though ye haue deliuered your exceptions in ſportfull manner, which as I doe not greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, ſo I do not greatly delight in, yet I muſt confeſſe euerie of them doth flie to the marke, and the blame reſteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, who might haue propoſed theſe matters to be diſcuſſed; but becauſe the
<pb facs="tcp:177736:8"/> lucre, or loſſe of the conference, was to redownd wholly to mee in all correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondencie of reaſon, and not to others, but by my curteſie: I thought it a more conuenient courſe, and more free and ingenious to follow the threed of mine owne choiſe, then the vncertaine winge of popular conceit. Againe, all things cannot be handled at all times, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be intruded into ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which doth not relice to the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And therefore the caſe was thus: The ſeruant of A. was arreſted in London vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a treſpaſſe, and two which did know his Maſter did baile him: and after A. promiſed them for their friendſhip to ſaue them harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of damages and coſtes, if afterward they were charged: And ſo it befell, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde they were charged: yet it was helde that the Action vpon the caſe would not lie vppon the promiſe, becauſe there was no
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177736:27"/> conſideration, for the bayling was of their owne head, and was executed before the aſſumpſit: But if the Maſter had requeſted before, and aſſured afterward then perhaps the law would haue beene otherwiſe: as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that you haue married my daughter at my requeſt I will giue you an hundred pound.

And ſo wheras <hi>Oneley</hi> brought an action vpon the caſe againſt the Earle of <hi>Kent</hi> and his Ladie, and declared vpon an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſit of the Ladie, whileſt ſhe was ſole, that in conſideration that he had taken great paines and had expended 1500. li. about her buſineſſe and ſuites, that ſhe would repay the 1500. li. and beſide that twentie pound more. This was held a good conſideration <note n="a" place="margin">19. Eliz. 356<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dy. Oneleys caſe.</note>: and 29.

<pb facs="tcp:177736:28"/> one of the Iuſtices ſaide, that if the dettee had brought an action vpon the caſe without any conſideration alleadged, and had proued the dette, that would haue ſufficed for that had beene an aſſumpſit in law: and that there muſt be a reciprocall conſideration in ſuch caſe may moſt clearely and euidently be proued, by 44. E. 3. A writte of dette was brought, and the plaintife declared that the defendant did owe vnto him fiue poundes for a houſe which hee had ſold vnto him: the defendant ſaid, that there was a couenant betwixt the plaintife &amp; the defendant, that the pr ſhold remoue the ſame houſe at his owne coſts &amp; charges within a certaine day to a certaine place, and when he had ſo remoued it, that then the defendant would pay him his money, and that the houſe (or the frame of the houſe) was not as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued: and this was held a good plea <note n="b" place="margin">44. E<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. 28.</note>. And where two conſiderations are to be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the performance of them both is to bee auerred: Wherefore the caſe was, that in an action of treſpaſſe the defendant pleaded a concord, that he before a certaine day ſhould make certayne windowes, and ſhould paye certaine money, and he ſaid that he payed the money by vertue of the concord before the day, and demaunded iudgement <hi>ſi actio &amp;c.</hi> But hee ſpoke nothing of the making of the windowes, and the plaintife replyed, <hi>Nul tiel

Firſt to ſpeake of the power of an Executor by our Law, it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wholie vpon the will and deſignement of the Teſtator: For if a man make three his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, and all refuſe the adminiſtration but one, yet the others ſhall be executors by vertue of the will, and may adminiſter when they
<pb facs="tcp:177736:42"/> pleaſe, and an action ought to be brought in all their names, otherwiſe the writ ſhall abate. And if a man haue goodes in diuerſe Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he may make his executors of his goodes in one of the prouinces, and die inteſtate as to the other goodes: And if the Ordinarie doe commit the adminiſtration of the goodes which are in the other prouince vnto him, now is he both executor and adminiſtrator <note n="e" place="margin">35.

But our Law diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from the Ciuill Law in this, that the adminiſtration of the goodes of him that dieth inteſtate is not committed by the <hi>Praetor,</hi> but by the Ordinarie: For if a man be indebted, and die inteſtate; or if the Executors of one that hath made a Will refuſe to be executors,
<pb facs="tcp:177736:43"/> whereby the goodes do come to the handes of the Ordinarie, the creditors may haue a writ of <hi>Dette</hi> againſt the Ordinarie by the ſtatute of <hi>Westminſter 2. cap.</hi> 19 <note n="p" place="margin">Fitzh.

But before the ſtatute of king <hi>Edw. the 3. ann 31. ca.</hi> 11. the adminiſtrators could not haue an action of <hi>Dette:</hi> therefore it ſeemeth before that time the Ordinarie might haue vſed an action of dette, otherwiſe remedie

(But then it ſeemeth that the money which they had for the ſale of the goodes was waſted by them, and not conuerted to the vſe of the teſtator: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there is no reaſon, but that they ſhould haue a propertie in them to their owne vſe) for if the executors pay the debtes of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator of their owne goodes, they may retaine the goodes of the teſtator to the value in their handes, to their owne vſe <note n="q" place="margin">6.

For if a man deliuer an Obligation to an other to receiue ſo much money as he can get of that which is contained in the bond, if he receiue no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney vpon the bond, a writ of Accompt lyeth not, but a writ of <hi>Detinue</hi> for the bond: (But it ſeemeth that if hee receiue a leſſe ſumme, then a writ of <hi>Accompt</hi> will lie:) But if he receiue the verie ſumme conteined in the bond, then a writ of <hi>Accompt</hi> will lie againſt him, as receiuor of his money. But if his bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be alſo bailie of his mannour, and this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation be deliuered vnto him as bailie of the mannour, then an Accompt will lie againſt him as bailie of the mannour <hi>habentem curam</hi> of this Obligation <note n="b" place="margin">2. R. 2. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt 46.</note>: for a bailie of a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour may well be tearmed a generall bailie. And <hi>Brian 2: R.</hi> 3. putteth an expreſſe difference betwixt a generall, and a ſpeciall bailie: A man ſaith he may be bailie of a mannour, or of an
<pb facs="tcp:177736:51"/> houſe, if he be bailie of a manour, he hath<note place="margin">3. What things belong to the charge of the bailie of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</note> charge of all the oxen, horſes, ploughes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the manour, and of all the profites ariſing, and growing out of the manour, and he ſhall be accomptable for them. But if he be bailie of an houſe he ſhall not be accompta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but onelie for the houſe <note n="c" place="margin">2. R. 3. 14. per Br.</note>. But this is the difference betwixt a bailie, and a receiuor, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bringing of a writ of Accompt. A writ of Accompt will not lie againſt one as bailie for a certaine and a peculier thing: But whereas A. giueth twentie pound to B. to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize for him, and to his vſe, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite hereof, becauſe it is a thing vncertaine, a writ of Accompt will lie, to the ende that by the writ of accompt the incertaintie may be brought to certaintie <note n="d" place="margin">9. H. 5. 3. per Hyl.</note>. But in your caſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the bailie is to bee intended a ſpeciall bailie. But this generall and currant rule we haue touching all bailies, as well generall, as ſpeciall: If the bailie be preiudiciall to his his maſter, he is to make recompence to his maſter: As if my bailie ſell a quarter of corne<note place="margin">4. That by the common Law if the baile be preiudiciall to his Maſter, he is to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.</note> for fortie pence, whereas he might haue ſold it for vj. s'. viij. pence, he muſt aunſweare for this <note n="e" place="margin">6. R. 2. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt 47. per Belkn.</note>.

E. 3. 3. per Finch.</note>. But if a baylie doe a thing which

E.</hi> 4. that the Lord may giue power (in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe wordes) to his bailie to leaſe land, and if the bailie hauing receiued ſuch authoritie doe leaſe an acre of land vnto a ſtranger, and doth not giue to the Lord notice thereof, if the Lord enter into this acre, the leſſee may puniſh him by an action of <hi>Treſpas,</hi> and yet he had no notice thereof: but the reaſon is becauſe he had before giuen ſuch a power to the bailie <note n="p" place="margin">8. E. 4. 1. et 9. Dutch. de Suffolkes c. per Catesb.</note>. And therefore I thinke that the book of 2. <hi>R.</hi> 3. which is, that the bailie hath power to leaſe land, and to improoue it, is to be intended (by ſpeciall warrant, and authoritie of the Lord committed vnto him.) But it ſeemeth that of himſelfe he may ſell trees if there be great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and may repaire houſes with them, but he cannot reedifie houſes with them, if they be falne <note n="q" place="margin">2. R 3. 14. 12. H. 7. 25</note>. But that a deputie hath an intereſt conioined with an authoritie in the thing, which is deputed vnto him may be thus prooued, 11. <hi>Elizab.</hi> it was cleerely reſolued, that two daughters being heires to the <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of England,</hi> might make their ſufficient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie to exerciſe the office for them, and after mariage that the husband of the elder onelie
<pb facs="tcp:177736:56"/> might performe the office <note n="r" place="margin">11. Elizab. 285. Dy.</note>. And 39. <hi>H.</hi> 6. it was agreed by all the Iuſtices, that if a man haue an office, and maketh a deputie, which miſuſeth the office, the grauntee or inheritour of the office ſhall forfait it, for the deputie is <hi>ſub officiario,</hi> and the officer remaineth officer vntill the forfaiture <note n="ſ" place="margin">39. H. 6. 32.</note>. And theſe wordes (that the deputie is <hi>ſub officiario</hi>) are ſo in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to be vnderſtood: as the leſſee at will is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the leſſor, in caſe of a demiſe of land: But there may be a forfaiture in the one caſe, and not in the other, becauſe in the office deputed there is a ſpeciall authoritie mixt with a ſpeciall intereſt. And <hi>Quaere,</hi> whether for the dette of the deputie the office may not be extended whileſt it is in the deputies handes.</p>

But if a houſe become ruinous for default of ſome couering, at the time of the death of the aunceſtor, and after the tenant ſuffereth the houſe to be more rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, the heire may haue an action of waſt for the late ruine, which happened after the death of the aunceſtor <note n="k" place="margin">2. Mari. Br. waſt. 117.</note>. Neither is it ſufficient in barre of a writ of waſte of a houſe that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant hath built a new houſe in lieu of that which is fallen, but the defendant muſt ſay that it is as much in length, and as much in latitude as the other was, or at leaſt hee muſt ſay, that it is as profitable: but when a houſe is rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and decayed at the time of the leaſe of it made, and it afterwarde falleth, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant buildeth a newe, it is not neceſſarie that hee ſhould make an other houſe of equall longitude or latitude <note n="l" place="margin">22.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177736:60"/> building a houſe ought to come in queſtion, as if the leſſee haue great need of a ſtable: and if no houſe be built vpon the land at the time of the leaſe, the leſſee may not cutte trees to make an houſe <note n="m" place="margin">11.

Yet in ſuch caſe a ſpeciall coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will binde the tenant. And therefore it was adiudged 15.

But if a man grant to me licence to make a trench from ſuch a fountaine in his land to my mannor of Dale, and that I may put a conduit-pipe in the land to conuay the water to my mannor, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the pipe bee ſtopped, I may dig in the land to amend the pipe <note n="k" place="margin">13.

B. at B. aforeſaid dyed, and the defendant hereupon did demurre in law. And the queſtion was whether this word (<hi>tunc</hi>) in the condition ſhould be referred to the time of the death of the wife: and it ſeemed to <hi>Mountague</hi> and <hi>Baldwin</hi> that it ſhould not, but that it ought to bee referred to a time cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: for euerie <hi>tunc</hi> relateth to his <hi>quando,</hi> but they thought that it ſhould bee referred to the feaſt which is certaine, and not to the death of the woman, which is vncertaine: but <hi>Shelley</hi> and <hi>Knightley</hi> thought otherwiſe. For in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers caſes relation ſhall not bee made <hi>ad proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum antecedens:</hi> as if a man make a leaſe for life the remainder in taile the remainder ouer to I.

And this was admitted to be good, and thereupon it may be concluded that (<hi>ſi</hi>) ſometimes in our lawe importeth a cauſe certaine, as the Dutcheſſe in this caſe was a certaine cauſe of the arbiterment <note n="i" place="margin">8.

                     <p>The verie ſame difference is<note place="margin">3. A difference betwixt a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at the common Law.</note> in our Law, which by caſes ſhall be explaned. A man graunteth to an other his manour of B. ſo that he paie 10. li. yearely to the leſſour, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of the leſſour: and if the ſaid rent be behind, that then it ſhall be lawfull for the leſſour to diſtraine for it in the leſſees manour of S. the leſſour hath a franktenement in the rent <hi>ſub modo,</hi> depending vpon the will of the leſſee (and the leſſour,) and there is a limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion implied by Law, though not verbally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <note n="t" place="margin">3.

So if a rent of 5. pound be graunted to I. as long as the grauntour, his heires or aſſignes ſhall hold the manour of W. this was adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be a freehold in the grauntee, but yet with a limitation <note n="uu" place="margin">10.

                        <note n="c" place="margin">37. H. 6. 29.</note>. So if a man deuiſe his land to his eldeſt ſonne in taile, with ſeuerall remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in taile, and that the partie morgaging, incumbring, entangling, or aliening the land, ſhall be clearelie diſcharged, excluded, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed touching the intaile, and the conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the intaile ſhal be of no force vnto him, this is not a condition, but a limitation: for if it were a condition, the right heire might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the breach, and defeat all the meane remainders in taile, which is not conſonant to the intent of the Deuiſour <note n="d" place="margin">13. et 14. Eliz. Com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Newyſes c. 403.</note>. And whereas you haue ſaid that a man by way of limitation may deuiſe money to be paied out of his cheſt or coffer, and if there be no money in the cheſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177736:72"/> or coffer, there is no money due, our Law dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth<note place="margin">4. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law is more ample and large then the Ciuil law in matter of limitation.</note> more amplie and beneficially in like caſes. For if a man graunt to me an annuitie of x. li. to receiue out of his coffers, if he haue neither coffers, nor money in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet his perſon ſhal be charged with the annuitie <note n="e" place="margin">Fitzh.

As if a man be bound to a feme ſole, and afterward he marieth her: Or if a man be bound to a villaine, and after he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the manour to which the villeine is regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, the mariage &amp; the purchaſe may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in auoidance of the eſpecialtie. So in an auoydance of a ſtatute merchant it is a good plea to ſaie that part of the land is purchaſed by the reconuſee. So in a writ of Annuitie, it is a good plea to ſaie, that he hath paied it in a foreine countie. So if a man by deede graunt a rent, if the grauntee ſurrender the rent with the eſpecialtie, this is a good auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

And if a defeaſance vpon a ſtatute marchant be, that the payment of the money ſhould be made at Briſtowe, and the conuſee receiued it at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, this is a good diſcharge of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for now the Law hath diſcharged it <note n="o" place="margin">46.

Which be conditions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law by the cenſure of the common Law.</note> them all: And firſt of Conditions againſt Law. If eſtates in land be made vppon conditions contrarie to Law, the eſtates be good, and the conditions voide: But then the eſtates muſt not begin, neither take effect by force of the condition, neither depende vpon ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as to the exiſtence of them. But if a man ſeiſed of land doe enfeoffe a ſtraunger vppon condition, that if the feoffour doe kill I.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:177736:75"/> Law. But if a leaſe for life be made, or a leaſe for yeares of land vpon condition, that if the leſſee kill I. S. within ſuch a day that then he ſhall haue and hold the land to him and to his heyres foreuer, notwithſtanding that the leſſee do kill I. S. within the day, yet his eſtate is not enlarged, becauſe the condition was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt law &amp; the eſtate ſhould haue beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by the performance of the condition, but notwithſtanding ſuch condition, yet the leaſe is good, becauſe that did not beginne by the condition. But if an obligation be endor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a condition directly contrarie to law, both the obligation, &amp; the condition be void <note n="a" place="margin">8. E. 4. 13. 2. E. 4. 3.</note>. And if a man be bound that he ſhall keepe the obligee without damages, and doe not ſhew wherein ſuch condition is voide, becauſe hee may ſuffer damages for committing treaſon, murder, or other felonie which thinges are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt law, and it is alſo againſt law, to ſaue him without damages for ſuch thinges, ſo that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition is void, but the obligation is not void, becauſe ſuch things are not expreſſely rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within the condition, ſo that the condition is not directly contrarie to law <note n="b" place="margin">9. H. 4. Conditions 6.</note>. And conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are repugnant in themſelues are voide in law: as if a feoffement or gift in tayle be made, that the feoffee or donee may not take the profits: or vpon condition, that they ſhall make no waſte: or vpon condition that
<pb facs="tcp:177736:76"/> the wife of the feoffee &amp;c. ſhal not be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or if a leaſe for life be made vpon condition that the leſſee ſhall doe no fealtie, theſe eſtates be good, and the conditions voide: or if an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie be granted, <hi>prouiſo</hi> that it ſhal not charge the perſon of the grauntor, the graunt is good the condition is voide <note n="c" place="margin">21.

But if a man ſeiſed of land in fee leaſe the ſaid land for yeares by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture rendring rent, <hi>prouiſo</hi> that the leſſor ſhall not diſtrein for the rent, this is a good <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſo</hi> becauſe the leſſor may haue an action of dette <note n="d" place="margin">5.

E. 3. 4. G. garrantie 18.</note>. And 7. H. 6. it was held by all the Iuſtices in the eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer chamber beſide <hi>Iune,</hi> that if a man make a feoffement with warrantie, <hi>prouiſo</hi> that the feoffee ſhall not vouch him and his heires, and that if he doe, the warrantie ſhall be voide, this is a good <hi>prouiſo.</hi> But if the <hi>prouiſo</hi> had beene that he ſhould neyther vouche nor rebutte, the <hi>prouiſo</hi> had beene void: for that had cut off all the force of the warrantie <note n="f" place="margin">7. H. 6. 44.</note>. And if two grant <hi>cuſtodiam parci de A.</hi> to <hi>I. capiendo feoda quae B. nuper parcarius cepit, prouiſo quòd ſcriptum non extendat ad onerandum vn des grauntors,</hi> this <hi>prouiſo</hi> was taken to be void, becauſe it reſtrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all the effect of the graunt in regarde of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:177736:76"/> him, and if land bee giuen in taile the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in fee, vpon condition that if the donee, or his heires do alien in fee, that the donor or his heires may enter, the opinion of the court was that this was a good condition: for a man may make a condition in the negatiue of any thing which is prohibited by the law, as if he make a feoffement, <hi>prouiſo</hi> that the feoffee ſhall not not committe felonie, or that hee ſhall ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en within age, or in mortmayne: and a man may enfeoffe A. and his wife vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſhall enfeoffe none other, for that were a diſcontinuance: otherwiſe it is that they ſhall not leuie a fine, for that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to their eſtate <note n="g" place="margin">10. H. 7. 8.</note>. So if a man make two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors, <hi>prouiſo</hi> that the one of them ſhall not adminiſter, this is a void <hi>prouiſo,</hi> becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayneth all the authoritie giuen in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as to him, and the intent which agreeth not with lawe is to no purpoſe <note n="h" place="margin">19. H. 8. 4. Dy. p Brud. &amp; Englef.</note>. And it hath beene agreede, that if a man doe limitte an vſe in taile with a <hi>prouiſo,</hi> that if <hi>ceſty que vſe</hi> doe ſuch an acte, his eſtate ſhall ceaſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his naturall life, that this <hi>prouiſo</hi> is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and againſt lawe, for the eſtate can not be determined in part. And Iuſtice <hi>Walm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley</hi> ſayd, that when an eſtate is giuen to one, it may bee defeated wholly by condition or limitation, but it cannot bee determined in parte to one, and giuen in parte to another:
<pb facs="tcp:177736:77"/> for that is repugnant to the rules of law, as if a man make a leaſe for life vpon condition that if the leſſee pay not twentie pound, that a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhal haue part of the land, this future limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<note place="margin">6 What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible in fact are at the common law.</note> is voide <note n="i" place="margin">41.

And as to conditions impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in facte, ſuch conditions if they go to the defeaſans of an eſtate, the eſtate notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding remaineth good: but eſtates cannot bee enlarged by ſuch a condition impoſſible: and if an obligation bee endorſed with a condition impoſſible, the obligation is good, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is voide. Therefore if a man ſeiſed of land doe enfeoffe a ſtraunger vpon condition that if the feoffor go on foote from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Stamford</hi> in a day, that then it ſhall bee lawfull for him and his heires to reenter, the condition is voide, <hi>quia impoſsibile,</hi> the eſtate good <note n="e" place="margin">14.

So if I buy of one the fiſhes which are taken by him, though he haue not alreadie taken any fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, yet the wordes doe imply a condition, that that the buyer ſhall haue them if any bee taken. So if I ſay, <hi>Acceptis centum ſolidis a Titio inſtituo eum haeredem,</hi> it is not meant that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of fiue pounde receiued of <hi>Titius</hi> I doe make him my heire or executor, but the words are conditionally meant: if the teſtator doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue 5. li. of <hi>Titius &amp;c</hi>

And if it were a condition, the 2. queſtion was, whether there were any breach of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the caſe. Some held that there was no breach of condition, becauſe the husband was poſſeſſed of the tearme by acte of law, &amp; is not an aſſignee no more then a tenant by the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is, or the land of a villaine. But <hi>Browne</hi> and <hi>Shelley</hi> held that the husband was an aſſignee in law, and that the land was ſubiect to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For before that time he was onely chargeable, but not charged. Sergeant <hi>Harris</hi> argued to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And Iuſtices ſaide, that the land of the party was in ſome ſort charged, for none
<pb facs="tcp:177736:79"/> in ſuch caſe would buy the land of the partie, but onely vnder the value, becauſe of the iudgement executorie <note n="n" place="margin">33. Eliz. Ridgeleys c.</note>.

                     <p>I haue noted in your wordes <hi>Codign.</hi> two thinges, which haue no ſmall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence and agreement with matters of our Law. Firſt in that by will according to your
<pb facs="tcp:177736:80"/> Law, an entrie may be limitted to a ſtraunger. 2. In that ye hold that he which defeateth the eſtate of him that breaketh the condition ſhall defeat his whole eſtate, and ſhal entirely claime the poſſeſſion. Which two aſſertions I ſhall ſeuerally prooue by caſes of Law beginning with the firſt: A man ſeiſed in fee of landes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſable,<note place="margin">3. By Will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Law an entrie may be limitted to a ſtranger.</note> did deuiſe them to one for terme of his life, and that he ſhould be a Chapplein, and that he ſhould chaunt for his ſoule all his life time, and that after his deceaſe the tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould remaine to the Cominaltie of a certaine village, to finde a chappleine perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall for the ſame tenements, and he died, and the deuiſee entred, and held the landes ſixe yeares and was no chappleine, and the heire of the deuiſour outed him, and he brought an <hi>Aſsiſe:</hi> And it ſeemed to the Court that the limitation that he ſhould be a chappleine was no condition, and that the heire could not enter, for then the remainder ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, which may not be, becauſe by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent a perpetuall chappleine ought to found <note n="u" place="margin">29. Aſſ. pla. 17.</note>: Whereby it appeareth that they in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were to take aduantage in this caſe of the breach of the thing that was to be done, and not the heire. So in <hi>Fitz Iames</hi> his caſe, the clauſe of entrie was limitted to him in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder for breach of the condition by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular tenant: for it was helde that the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:177736:80"/> might determine the eſtate, and that being determined, he in the remainder might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note n="uu" place="margin">13. et 14. Elizab. Com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 403. Newyſes caſe.</note>. Alſo 34. E. 3. the caſe was, that a man had iſſue a ſonne and a daughter, and deuiſed land deuiſable to one for life, vpon condition, that if the ſonne ſhould diſturbe the tenant for life, that the land ſhould remaine to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the heires of her bodie, the father di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the ſonne diſturbeth the tenant for life, who dieth, the daughter brought a <hi>Formedon,</hi> and it was allowed <note n="a" place="margin">34.

Mar. 117. Dy.</note>. And an other caſe was equally doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Wilford</hi> was bound in an Obligation without daie of payment limitted, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed his land to his executors vppon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that if they did not paie the ſaid ſumme according to the obligation, that the deuiſe ſhould be voide, and that then A. ſhould haue the land to him and to his heires vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon condition that hee paied the money,
<pb facs="tcp:177736:81"/> 
                        <hi>Wilford</hi> died, A. died, the executors are reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to pay the money, and they would not pay it, the queſtion of the booke left vndeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is whether the heire of A. may enter into the land, and paie the money <note n="c" place="margin">3. Mar. 128. Dy.</note>. In like maner land in Gauelkind was deuiſed to the eldeſt ſonne vpon condition, that he ſhould paie 100. li. to the wife of the deuiſour, he fayled of the payment, it was queſtioned by <hi>Manwood,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the yonger ſonne might enter into the moitie, as by an implied limitation <note n="d" place="margin">15. Eliz. 317. Dy.</note>. But touching ſuch entries by force of ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all limitation or condition, <hi>Mast. Frowike</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a good rule 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. that an eſtate of inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance can not ceaſe by vertue of a condition broken onelie, but there ought to be alſo an entrie: But otherwiſe it is of a particular eſtate, and the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch an eſtate may be determined by word as by ſurrender: and by the ſame reaſon it may ceaſe by the wordes of the condition <note n="e" place="margin">21. H. 7. 12. per Frowike.</note>. Now that the<note place="margin">5. That the entrie for the condition bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, defeateth the whole eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</note> whole eſtate of the feoffee or donee is defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the breach of the condition, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of the partie, may be prooued by diuerſe authorities in our Law, and that there can be no fraction of the condition, 14. <hi>Elizab.</hi> all the Iuſtices agreed: And ſo was iudgement giuen in <hi>Winters caſe,</hi> that by the graunt of the reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of part of the landes, with which a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition runneth, the condition is wholie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:177736:81"/> becauſe it is a thing penall and entire, and may not be apportioned nor diuided <note n="f" place="margin">14. Elizab. 308. Dy.</note>. And 33. of Henrie the eight, according to <hi>Mast. Brookes</hi> report, it was helde for Law, that if a man giue land in taile, or leaſe it for life, rendring rent, with a condition for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of payment to reenter: now if he leaſe part of the land to the donour, or leſſour, or if the donour or leſſour enter into part of the land, he cannot enter for rent behind after, but the condition is wholie ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe a condition cannot be appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned or diuided. Therefore ſome ſcruple may with good reaſon be made of the caſe 16. <hi>Elizab.</hi> in my Lord <hi>Dyers</hi> reportes, A man leaſed land for yeares, vppon condition that the leſſee ſhould not alien the land to anie perſon without the aſſent of the leſſour, nor any part of the land, the leſſour giueth licence to alien part, and the leſſee alieneth the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due without licence, it was adiudged that the leſſour may enter notwithſtanding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the condition <hi>ex parte</hi> 
                        <note n="g" place="margin">16. Elizab. 334. Dy.</note>. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer 5. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. be to the ſame purpoſe, that a man enfeoffed two vppon condition to make backe a leaſe for life to the feoffour, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in fee to a ſtraunger: the one of them onelie maketh eſtate accordingly. And by the opinion of manie, this is good for a moitie by
<pb facs="tcp:177736:82"/> the diſpenſation of the partie, who might take aduantage of the condition by his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of eſtate <note n="h" place="margin">5. Ed. 6. 69. Dy.</note>. For 23. <hi>Elizab.</hi> the caſe was ſuch: A man was bound in an hundred pound to giue to the obligee the moitie of all the fiſhes taken by his water-mille, he tooke twentie one fiſhes, and gaue tenne to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligee, and an action of <hi>Dette</hi> was brought vpon the obligation, and the plaintife reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, becauſe he did not giue vnto him the moitie of the other fiſhe. This was adiudged in the Kinges Bench. But now ſuppoſe that the condition doth extende onelie to ſome particular eſtates, whether ſhall the other eſtates depending bee totallie defeated by the breach of the condition? And ſurelie our Law is, that the breach of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall defeat no eſtate, but onelie that whereunto it is annexed. For the caſe was 3. <hi>Mar.</hi> that a man deuiſed land to his wife vppon condition, that ſhee ſhould bring vp his eldeſt ſonne, the remainder to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſonne: The elder ſonne entreth for the condition broken, hee ſhall onelie defeate the eſtate of the wife. And if the tenant for life, and hee in the remainder ioine in a feoffement vppon condition, that if ſuch an acte be not done, that the tenant for life ſhall reenter, this doth not defeate the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:177736:82"/> eſtate of the feoffee <note n="i" place="margin">3. Mar. 125. Dy.</note>. And if a gift of land be made in taile, the remainder to the right heires of the donee, vppon condition that if hee alien in fee, then the donour may enter, if the donour enter for the condition broken, the eſtate taile is onelie defeated <note n="k" place="margin">11. H. 7. 6. 13. H. 7. 23. 10. H. 7. 11.</note>. So if a man leaſe land for life by deede in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented, the remainder ouer in fee rendring a rent with clauſe of reentrie for non pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the tenant for life, and to reteigne the land during his life: If hee enter for the condition broken, he ſhall haue the land onlie during the life of the tenant for life <note n="l" place="margin">29.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>L Nations in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting difference betwixt times and ſeaſons haue rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a populer and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſeruation, then the preciſe rules and principles of Aſtronomy, accompting it more conuenient and requiſite, that ſithence all contracts and matters of entercourſe doe fall within the liſtes and precincts of time, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moments and meaſures of time ſhould be publikely and familiarly knowne to populer conceit: In ſetting downe the definition of Time, they agree in the ſubſtance and matter it ſelfe, though in wordes and tearmes they be ſomewhat diſſonant. <hi>Aristotle</hi> a great Philoſopher amongſt the <hi>Graecians</hi> defineth Time to be the <hi>meaſure of motion, according to prioritie and poſterioritie,</hi> a
<pb facs="tcp:177736:97"/> ſhort and ſubtill definition, but yet true &amp; ſound. <hi>Varro</hi> as great and famous amongſt the <hi>Romanes</hi> defineth it to be <hi>interuallum mundi &amp; motus, the ſpace of the world and motion,</hi> a briefe definition and verie nimble, if it be nimbly vnderſtood: for by the world he meaneth the courſe of time, by motion the courſe of thinges. Others, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> haue defined it a <hi>dimenſion perceyued by the conuerſion of the heauens. Plato,</hi> who of theſe matters had in his trauayle conference with <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> defineth it to be a moueable and chaungeable repreſentation of Eternitie; <note n="c" place="margin">Plat. in Tim.</note> and truely and aptly doth he tearme it a chaungeable repreſentation or image of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: for as <hi>Cenſorinus</hi> noteth, <hi>Time in regarde of Eternitie, is but a winters day.</hi> 
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Cenſo. c. 4. de di. na.</note> But though time be as much obſcured in eternitie, as a ſmall penny is amongeſt the riches of <hi>Craeſus,</hi> yet as that was part of his riches, ſo time muſt needes be a part of Eternitie. <hi>Cicero</hi> defineth time more vulgarly, <hi>to be a part of Eternitie with a certaine difference, of a yearely, monethly, daily, and nightly distance,</hi> 
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Cic. lib. de ſin. 4.</note> ſo that <hi>Plato</hi> his definition hath relation to the cauſe of time; <hi>Ciceroes</hi> to the perſons that make vſe of time. <hi>Philoſophers</hi> haue left to poſteritie many ſubtill, deepe, and learned diſcourſes of time, but bidding their definitions and diſputations fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, I will examine and weye the diſtinct partes of time with a popular ballance, and according to common ſence, taking that courſe to be moſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177736:97"/> ſutable to my profeſſion. The partes of time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the generall diuiſion of Nations are a yeare, a moneth, a day, an howre, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the <hi>Olympiads</hi> and <hi>Lustra,</hi> as being proper to the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from this Treatiſe, and <hi>Seculum</hi> as being a thing not vſuall in law, which now we handle muſt likewiſe be caſſierd. Yet in ſpeaking of time we may not forget to handle the circumſtances of time as they be accommodated to the Law, and to the actions of men: As namely of a long time, a ſhort time, a late time, an auncient time, a certaine time, an vncertaine time, a continuall time, a conuenient time, time paſt, time preſent, and time future. But firſt to ſpeake of the yeare, <hi>Annus</hi> according to the Etymologie learnedly ſearched out by <hi>Varro,</hi> is nothing els but a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit: for as the little circles are called <hi>annuli,</hi> ringes; ſo the great circles or compaſſes of time are called <hi>Anni,</hi> yeares <note n="f" place="margin">Var. lib. 5. de lingu. lat.</note>. The yeare is a time, wherein the Sunne perfitteth his courſe, and that is accompliſhed in the ſpace of three hundred, three ſcoore, and fiue dayes, and ſixe howres al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: And this hath our Law well obſerued, as may appeare by theſe verſes:
<q>
                           <l>Ter centum, ter viginti, cum quinque diebus,</l>
                           <l>Sex horas, neque plus integer annus habet <note n="g" place="margin">18. Elizab. 345. Dyer.</note>.</l>
                        </q> by which accompt (if you ſubtract the howers and halfe dayes) the quarter of the yeare will fall out as it is in our Law ſet downe, to be nintie and
<pb facs="tcp:177736:98"/> one dayes; and the halfe yeare, a hundred eightie and two dayes, <note n="h" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> which was almoſt fully ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <hi>Ianus</hi> his image in <hi>Rome,</hi> in whoſe right hand was the number of three hundred, and in his left hand fiftie and fiue. <note n="i" place="margin">Macrob. lib. 1. Stur. ca. 9.</note> Others haue made the ſame difference betwixt the yeare and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth which the Merchants of ſome Countries make betwixt the ounce and the pound, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their conceit in this verſe:
<q>Vncia<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> in libra pars est, quae menſis in anno.</q> And though it be a common receiued opinion, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> at the firſt, and a long time after the foundation of their Citie did accompt but tenne monethes for the yeare, ſo that <hi>Ouid</hi> quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with <hi>Romulus</hi> his Aſtronomy in this maner: <note n="k" place="margin">Ouid. lib. 1. faſtor.</note>
                        <q>Scilicet arma magis quàm ſydera Romule noras.</q> Yet if the courſe &amp; circumduction of their yeare be well obſerued, it will appeare to haue contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the full ſpace of twelue monethes, as may appeare by <hi>Plinie</hi> 
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Plin. lib. 2. ca. 9.</note>, <hi>Macrobius</hi> 
                        <note n="m" place="margin">Macrob. 1. Satur. ca. 12. et lib. 1. in ſom. Scip. c. 6.</note>, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> 
                        <note n="n" place="margin">Plut. in Num.</note>. And this was likewiſe the yeare of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The <hi>Romanes</hi> did begin their vulgar yeare at the beginning of Winter, as appeareth by <hi>Ouid:</hi>
                        <q>Bruma noui prima eſt veterisquè nouiſsima ſolis.</q> Which courſe ſeemeth to bee agreeable to the courſe of nature, becauſe then the ſunne begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to returne vnto vs, and therefore wee may rightly deriue the beginning of his circuite from thence: The yeare is diuided into the Spring, Summer, Harueſt, &amp; Winter.
